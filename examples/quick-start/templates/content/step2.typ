Place all required files and fonts in the configured directories.

*Template directory* (`template-dir`): All files are embedded and can be accessed from `.typ` files.

*Fonts directory* (`fonts-dir`): Supports TTF, OTF, and TTC formats. At least one font is required. If your document includes equations or code blocks, add dedicated fonts for them. See the `font-guide` example for details.
